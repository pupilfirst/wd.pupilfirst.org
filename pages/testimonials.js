                        Having the opportunity to learn from Pupilfirst
                        professionals has been extremely beneficial to me. I
                        didn't have a well-structured knowledge of NodeJs as I'm
                        a self-taught programmer. However, the courses taught me
                        the fundamentals of code structure and accepted project
                        methods. The capstone project's challenges have improved
                        my problem-solving abilities. This has piqued my
                        interest in learning and exploring more. Furthermore,
                        I'll be honored to serve as a TA. In the process, I'll
                        improve my skills by assisting others. I'm excited to
                        work with the Pupilfirst team!

                      <blockquote>
                        I began my software engineer journey during the covid
                        pandemic. I discovered an interest in Web improvement. I
                        learned concepts of Javascript, React environment,
                        MongoDb and NodeJs. However, I want to get my hands
                        dirty, and I want to work on real-world projects. I got
                        an email from the school about the CoronaSafe Network
                        and I quickly applied. After finishing the assignment I
                        got chosen for the interview. As it was my first
                        interview I was very nervous. Jasim took my interview
                        and he was excessively amicable to the point that I
                        forgot It was the interview. On 14 Jan, the selected
                        student list was announced and I was stunned! I got
                        chosen for the fellowship. Out of 50,000+applicants,
                        only 24 students were selected and I was one of them.
                        After smooth onboarding, we began to work on the ARIKE
                        project. Sharing your ideas with team members and
                        understanding other's opinions is only possible if you
                        work in a team environment. I learned the software
                        development process, how to organize your code, got
                        real-world experience of Typescript and React projects.
                        I learned to optimize code and much more. The main thing
                        I like about fellowship is you don't have to compromise
                        your academics. This is what I was expecting from the
                        fellowship. Coronsafe Fellowship was above my
                        expectations. Coronasafe Engineering Fellowship is one
                        of the best things that happened to my software
                        developer journey. Smooth onboarding, friendly mentors,
                        everything is just perfect. It was a nice experience
                        working with industry experts.

                      <blockquote>
                        Before joining the fellowship, all I knew was to code in
                        a few languages but if asked to develop an entire web
                        app on my own, I would have probably passed on the
                        opportunity. Even with so many tutorials online, I often
                        get confused about where to start and what topics are
                        worth learning. That is when I chanced upon this
                        fellowship and decided to give it a shot. I saw the
                        coding assignment given to us as an opportunity to build
                        a project for my Github profile and I even took the risk
                        of coding in a language that I had only learnt for three
                        months then. One thing led to the other and I am super
                        grateful to have been selected for this fellowship! The
                        10-week training that we had, opened me up to the world
                        of web development which I probably would not have
                        explored without the motivation and sense of community I
                        experienced from my mentors and peers. With a
                        well-defined curriculum, we were encouraged to ask
                        doubts no matter how small they were and I loved how we
                        were pushed to explore concepts beyond the material
                        given. Pointers on how programming in the tech industry
                        should be done were immensely helpful and have changed
                        the way I think while writing code. My first ever web
                        app and first-ever pull request for an open-source
                        project are only a few of many opportunities that this
                        fellowship has created for me and I couldn't have asked
                        for more!

                        My Internship Journey with CoronaSafe Network was super
                        amazing. It was very interesting to learn Web
                        Development and build out tools for serving the nation.
                        I have learnt technical skills like Functional
                        Programming, working with MVCs and a lot more. I have
                        also learnt soft skills including how to do pair
                        programming, to work in teams, speaking etiquettes and
                        more. I thank Pupilfirst, CoronaSafe &amp; AICTE for
                        giving me this opportunity!

                        Few weeks after my training started, I was very much
                        motivated to learn more new stuff. It was really
                        inspiring how my mentors were guiding me in each and
                        every step. Once my training period was over, I joined
                        with my mates in a project called ARIKE which is a
                        centralized software system for Palliative Care. It made
                        me even more excited to contribute to the Open Source
                        World.

                        I even started digging the source code of most popular

                        worked on a project called LIFE which served the
                        emergency leads to millions of people around the nation.
                        It was a great experience while working on an
                        application which just scaled up in a single week.

                        I could make myself contribute some translations for the
                        project. Also, worked on its Dashboard, revamping its
                        performance by implementing new frameworks. I thank all

                        to improve my coding skills, but I got lots more out of
                        it.

                        We had AMA sessions on Tuesdays with industry experts
                        and entrepreneurs which were interesting and motivating.
                        During our training, we happen to do assignments that
                        will be reviewed, and suggestions on how to improve them
                        further were given which was really helpful.

                        I learned new stacks like Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL,
                        rescript, React, and Django, some of which I never used
                        before. I got first-hand experience working on
                        applications that were in production and used by
                        multiple state governments to combat COVID-19. The best
                        part of this fellowship is that I met so many new
                        people, fellow interns, coaches, developers, managers,
                        and many others, all of them were easily approachable
                        and helpful.

                        We did lots of peer coding with other fellows, which was
                        new and interesting, this helped me learn new coding
                        styles and approaches. To summarize all this in a single
                        sentence, I had a very productive, fun, and unique
                        experience throughout my fellowship.

                        The fellowship not only taught me new technologies but
                        also very valuable best practices, programming paradigms
                        which is helping me a lot at work now. My favourite part
                        was one to one interaction with the coaches as they were
                        super fun and the most helpful!
